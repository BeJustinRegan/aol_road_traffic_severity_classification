This data set was collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city, Ethiopia, police departments for master’s students’ research work. The data set was prepared from manual documents of road traffic accidents for the years 2017–20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding, and finally, it has 32 features and 12316 rows of an accident. Then it is preprocessed for the identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different classification algorithms. Machine learning models will be evaluated and thereafter deployed on a cloud-based platform in order to make them usable for end users.

The target feature is “Accident_severity,” which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each data science process and task. Our metric for evaluation will be your “F1 score.”

I'm here as a machine learning specialist, where I do EDA visualization, data preprocessing, and machine learning model evaluation. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, the end-to-end data science and machine learning project successfully presented the potential for using data analysis and prediction to aid in the prevention of road accident fatalities. By thoroughly analyzing the provided data and training a machine learning model to predict the severity of potential accidents, the investigation agency can prioritize its efforts and resources toward the most high-risk situations. This project highlights the value of using data-driven approaches to address complex problems and the importance of continued investment in these initiatives. Let’s look at the key takeaways from this article.
