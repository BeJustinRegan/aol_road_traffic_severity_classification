This data set was collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city, Ethiopia, police departments for master’s students’ research work. The data set was prepared from manual documents of road traffic accidents for the years 2017–20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding, and finally, it has 32 features and 12316 rows of an accident. Then it is preprocessed for the identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different classification algorithms. Machine learning models will be evaluated and thereafter deployed on a cloud-based platform in order to make them usable for end users.

The target feature is “Accident_severity,” which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each data science process and task. Our metric for evaluation will be your “F1 score.”

I'm here as a machine learning specialist, where I do EDA visualization, data preprocessing, and machine learning model evaluation.
